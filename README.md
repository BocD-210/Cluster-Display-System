# Simulation of Cluster Display System in Automotive
Simulation of an automotive system featuring a **Digital Instrument Cluster (IPC)** and a **Vehicle Control Unit (VCU)** for electric vehicles, built on hardware platforms such as **Raspberry Pi** and **STM32 microcontroller**, and utilizing the **CAN Bus** communication protocol. The VCU is responsible for managing vehicle states, while STM32-based **Electronic Control Unit (ECU) nodes** run a common firmware to ensure scalability and deployment flexibility. This system demonstrates an **Electrical and Electronic (E/E) Architecture**, incorporating both **Domain-Centralized E/E Architecture** and **Zonal E/E Architecture**, and combined with **Humanâ€“Machine Interface (HMI** design in compliance with **ISO 2575** for symbols and displays as well as **ISO 26262** for functional safety. At the same time, the CAN bus standard is employed to guarantee real-time data exchange between the VCU, IPC, and ECUs, establishing a platform for research and development suitable for smart automotive applications.

## Key Features.

- **Digital HMI:** HMI design based on Qt/QML displaying vehicle speed, battery level, distance traveled, temperature, gear position (P, R, N, D), and warning indicators in compliance with ISO 2575 for symbols and displays.
- **VCU with CAN Bus Communication:** VCU manages vehicle states and I/O, enabling real-time communication with ECUs via CAN bus.
- **SocketCAN in Linux:** Integrated SocketCAN on Raspberry Pi to send/receive CAN frames in real, enabling real-time communication with ECUs via CAN bus. Supports CAN analysis tools (candump, cansend, can-utils, e.g.) for debugging and logging data.
- **Real-Time Processing:** Low-latency data handling with ADC via DMA. FIFO queues for CAN frames and Qt signal-slot mechanism.
- **Humanâ€“Machine Interface (HMI):** Intuitive and user-friendly interface design, compliant with functional safety principles defined in ISO 26262.
## System Requirements.
